  <li>5.Which country has made the highest booking? 
  <li>6.What were the most active business month?

  <li>8.What were the most active business day?
  <li>9.Which country has cancelled more booking?
  <li>10.Which month has most booking cancellation?
</ul>


## 3. **Conclusion**

<p align='justify'> Hotel analysis dataset was loaded, cleaned and utilized for exploratory data analysis for the factors that drives the booking of the hotels.  Libraries like pandas, matplotlib, seaborn were used to clean, manipulate and visualize the data. Most of the guests preferred resorts over city hotels. However, city hotels were producing more revenue. Portugal was the country which perform most of the booking as well it, cancellation rates were also higher for this country. Many of the potential covariates could be explored more if this project would further extended. </p>
